This was built entirely in HolyC which is the programming language used in TempleOS and this was my first time using HolyC so the code is probably not very good. I also had a hard time to figure out how to get a qemu virtual disk to work with TempleOS so I had to do a lot of experimentation with OS configuration to get it right.

## Running on your own machine

1. Install QEMU (for virtualization). If you don't wanna use a VM, you're on your own :)
2. Clone this repository.
3. Use the `./build-project-iso.sh` script to prepare the TempleOS ISO. This will create a `ProjectCD.iso` file in the root of the repository.
4. Run `qemu-img create -f raw templeos-hdd.img 512M)`
5. Run the `./tos-install.sh` (Make sure to select Yes when it asks if you wanna install it).
6. Run `./tos-dev.sh` to start the VM.
7. Once inside, you can run the program by `#include "T:/Main.HC"`


### AI Usage Declaration
I had tab completions on and I used claudecode to debug the issues I had to get the qemu virtual disk to work with TempleOS. AI wasn't much helpful in the code itself tho.
